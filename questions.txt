1. In an A/B test, how can you check if assignment to the various buckets was truly random?
Plot the distributions of multiple features for both A and B and make sure that they have the same shape. More rigorously, we can conduct a permutation test to see if the distributions are the same.
MANOVA to compare different means
---------------------
2. What might be the benefits of running an A/A test, where you have two buckets who are exposed to the exact same product?
Verify the sampling algorithm is random.
3. What would be the hazards of letting users sneak a peek at the other bucket in an A/B test?
The user might not act the same suppose had they not seen the other bucket. You are essentially adding additional variables of whether the user peeked the other bucket, which are not random across groups.
4. What would be some issues if blogs decide to cover one of your experimental groups?
Same as the previous question. The above problem can happen in larger scale.
5. How would you conduct an A/B test on an opt-in feature? 
Ask someone for more details.
6. How would you run an A/B test for many variants, say 20 or more?
one control, 20 treatment, if the sample size for each group is big enough.
Ways to attempt to correct for this include changing your confidence level (e.g. Bonferroni Correction) or doing family-wide tests before you dive in to the individual metrics (e.g. Fisher's Protected LSD).
7. How would you run an A/B test if the observations are extremely right-skewed?
lower the variability by modifying the KPI
cap values
percentile metrics
log transform

8. I have two different experiments that both change the sign-up button to my website. I want to test them at the same time. What kinds of things should I keep in mind?
exclusive -> ok
9. What is a p-value? What is the difference between type-1 and type-2 error?
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value
type-1 error: rejecting Ho when Ho is true
type-2 error: not rejecting Ho when Ha is true
10. You are AirBnB and you want to test the hypothesis that a greater number of photographs increases the chances that a buyer selects the listing. How would you test this hypothesis?
For randomly selected listings with more than 1 pictures, hide 1 random picture for group A, and show all for group B. Compare the booking rate for the two groups.
Ask someone for more details.
11. How would you design an experiment to determine the impact of latency on user engagement?
The best way I know to quantify the impact of performance is to isolate just that factor using a slowdown experiment, i.e., add a delay in an A/B test.
12. What is maximum likelihood estimation? Could there be any case where it doesn’t exist?
A method for parameter optimization (fitting a model). We choose parameters so as to maximize the likelihood function (how likely the outcome would happen given the current data and our model).
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations, by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters. MLE can be seen as a special case of the maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters, or as a variant of the MAP that ignores the prior and which therefore is unregularized.
for gaussian mixtures, non parametric models, it doesn’t exist
13. What’s the difference between a MAP, MOM, MLE estimator? In which cases would you want to use each?
MAP estimates the posterior distribution given the prior distribution and data which maximizes the likelihood function. MLE is a special case of MAP where the prior is uninformative uniform distribution.
MOM sets moment values and solves for the parameters. MOM is not used much anymore because maximum likelihood estimators have higher probability of being close to the quantities to be estimated and are more often unbiased.
14. What is a confidence interval and how do you interpret it?
For example, 95% confidence interval is an interval that when constructed for a set of samples each sampled in the same way, the constructed intervals include the true mean 95% of the time.
if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level in an infinite number of independent experiments, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level.
15. What is unbiasedness as a property of an estimator? Is this always a desirable property when performing inference? What about in data analysis or predictive modeling?
Unbiasedness means that the expectation of the estimator is equal to the population value we are estimating. This is desirable in inference because the goal is to explain the dataset as accurately as possible. However, this is not always desirable for data analysis or predictive modeling as there is the bias variance tradeoff. We sometimes want to prioritize the generalizability and avoid overfitting by reducing variance and thus increasing bias.

messaging product: 
daily, monthly active users
5. What would be good metrics of success for a product that offered in-app purchases? (Zynga, Angry Birds, other gaming apps)
Average Revenue Per Paid User
Average Revenue Per User
6. A certain metric is violating your expectations by going down or up more than you expect. How would you try to identify the cause of the change?
breakdown the KPI’s into what consists them and find where the change is
then further breakdown that basic KPI by channel, user cluster, etc. and relate them with any campaigns, changes in user behaviors in that segment
7. Growth for total number of tweets sent has been slow this month. What data would you look at to determine the cause of the problem?
Historical data, especially historical data at the same month
Outer data, such as economic data, political data, data about competitors
8. You’re a restaurant and are approached by Groupon to run a deal. What data would you ask from them in order to determine whether or not to do the deal?
for similar restaurants (they should define similarity), average increase in revenue gain per coupon, average increase in customers per coupon
9. You are tasked with improving the efficiency of a subway system. Where would you start?
define efficiency
10. Say you are working on Facebook News Feed. What would be some metrics that you think are important? How would you make the news each person gets more relevant?
rate for each action, duration users stay, CTR for sponsor feed posts
ref. News Feed Optimization
Affinity score: how close the content creator and the users are
Weight: weight for the edge type (comment, like, tag, etc.). Emphasis on features the company wants to promote
Time decay: the older the less important
11. How would you measure the impact that sponsored stories on Facebook News Feed have on user engagement? How would you determine the optimum balance between sponsored stories and organic content on a user’s News Feed?
AB test on different balance ratio and see 
12. You are on the data science team at Uber and you are asked to start thinking about surge pricing. What would be the objectives of such a product and how would you start looking into this?
 there is a gradual step-function type scaling mechanism until that imbalance of requests-to-drivers is alleviated and then vice versa as too many drivers come online enticed by the surge pricing structure. 
I would bet the algorithm is custom tailored and calibrated to each location as price elasticities almost certainly vary across different cities depending on a huge multitude of variables: income, distance/sprawl, traffic patterns, car ownership, etc. With the massive troves of user data that Uber probably has collected, they most likely have tweaked the algorithms for each city to adjust for these varying sensitivities to surge pricing. Throw in some machine learning and incredibly rich data and you've got yourself an incredible, constantly-evolving algorithm.
13. Say that you are Netflix. How would you determine what original series you should invest in and create?

1. (Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and tell me what you can learn from it.
Typical data cleaning and visualization
2. What is R2? What are some other metrics that could be better than R2 and why?
goodness of fit measure. variance explained by the regression / total variance
the more predictors you add, the higher R^2 becomes.
hence use adjusted R^2 which adjusts for the degrees of freedom 
or train error metrics
3. What is the curse of dimensionality?
High dimensionality makes clustering hard, because having lots of dimensions means that everything is "far away" from each other.
For example, to cover a fraction of the volume of the data we need to capture a very wide range for each variable as the number of variables increases
All samples are close to the edge of the sample. And this is a bad news because prediction is much more difficult near the edges of the training sample.
The sampling density decreases exponentially as p increases and hence the data becomes much more sparse without significantly more data. 
We should conduct PCA to reduce dimensionality
4. Is more data always better?
Statistically
It depends on the quality of your data, for example, if your data is biased, just getting more data won’t help.
It depends on your model. If your model suffers from high bias, getting more data won’t improve your test results beyond a point. You’d need to add more features, etc.
Practically
More data usually benefit the models
Also there’s a tradeoff between having more data and the additional storage, computational power, memory it requires. Hence, always think about the cost of having more data.
5. What are advantages of plotting your data before performing analysis?
Data sets have errors. You won't find them all but you might find some. That 212 year old man. That 9 foot tall woman.
Variables can have skewness, outliers, etc. Then the arithmetic mean might not be useful, which means the standard deviation isn't useful.
Variables can be multimodal! If a variable is multimodal then anything based on its mean or median is going to be suspect. 
6. How can you make sure that you don’t analyze something that ends up meaningless?
Proper exploratory data analysis.
In every data analysis task, there's the exploratory phase where you're just graphing things, testing things on small sets of the data, summarizing simple statistics, and getting rough ideas of what hypotheses you might want to pursue further.
Then there's the exploratory phase, where you look deeply into a set of hypotheses. 
The exploratory phase will generate lots of possible hypotheses, and the exploratory phase will let you really understand a few of them. Balance the two and you'll prevent yourself from wasting time on many things that end up meaningless, although not all.
7. What is the role of trial and error in data analysis? What is the the role of making a hypothesis before diving in?
data analysis is a repetition of setting up a new hypothesis and trying to refute the null hypothesis.
The scientific method is eminently inductive: we elaborate a hypothesis, test it and refute it or not. As a result, we come up with new hypotheses which are in turn tested and so on. This is an iterative process, as science always is.
8. How can you determine which features are the most important in your model?
Linear regression can use p-value
run the features though a Gradient Boosting Machine or Random Forest to generate plots of relative importance and information gain for each feature in the ensembles.
Look at the variables added in forward variable selection 
9. How do you deal with some of your predictors being missing?
Remove rows with missing values - This works well if
the values are missing randomly (see Vinay Prabhu's answer for more details on this)
if you don't lose too much of the dataset after doing so.
Build another predictive model to predict the missing values
This could be a whole project in itself, so simple techniques are usually used here.
Use a model that can incorporate missing data 
Like a random forest, or any tree-based method.
10. You have several variables that are positively correlated with your response, and you think combining all of the variables could give you a good prediction of your response. However, you see that in the multiple linear regression, one of the weights on the predictors is negative. What could be the issue?
Multicollinearity refers to a situation in which two or more explanatory variables in a multiple regression model are highly linearly related. 
Leave the model as is, despite multicollinearity. The presence of multicollinearity doesn't affect the efficiency of extrapolating the fitted model to new data provided that the predictor variables follow the same pattern of multicollinearity in the new data as in the data on which the regression model is based.
principal component regression
11. Let’s say you’re given an unfeasible amount of predictors in a predictive modeling task. What are some ways to make the prediction more feasible?
PCA
12. Now you have a feasible amount of predictors, but you’re fairly sure that you don’t need all of them. How would you perform feature selection on the dataset?
ridge / lasso / elastic net regression
Univariate Feature Selection where a statistical test is applied to each feature individually. You retain only the best features according to the test outcome scores
Recursive Feature Elimination:
First, train a model with all the feature and evaluate its performance on held out data.
Then drop let say the 10% weakest features (e.g. the feature with least absolute coefficients in a linear model) and retrain on the remaining features.
Iterate until you observe a sharp drop in the predictive accuracy of the model.
13. Your linear regression didn’t run and communicates that there are an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients. What could be wrong?
p > n.
If some of the explanatory variables are perfectly correlated (positively or negatively) then the coefficients would not be unique. 
14. You run your regression on different subsets of your data, and find that in each subset, the beta value for a certain variable varies wildly. What could be the issue here?
The dataset might be heterogeneous. In which case, it is recommended to cluster datasets into different subsets wisely, and then draw different models for different subsets. Or, use models like non parametric models (trees) which can deal with heterogeneity quite nicely.
15. What is the main idea behind ensemble learning? If I had many different models that predicted the same response variable, what might I want to do to incorporate all of the models? Would you expect this to perform better than an individual model or worse?
The assumption is that a group of weak learners can be combined to form a strong learner.
Hence the combined model is expected to perform better than an individual model.
Assumptions:
average out biases
reduce variance
Bagging works because some underlying learning algorithms are unstable: slightly different inputs leads to very different outputs. If you can take advantage of this instability by running multiple instances, it can be shown that the reduced instability leads to lower error. If you want to understand why, the original bagging paper( http://www.springerlink.com/) has a section called "why bagging works"
Boosting works because of the focus on better defining the "decision edge". By re-weighting examples near the margin (the positive and negative examples) you get a reduced error (see http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie...)
Use the outputs of your models as inputs to a meta-model. 
For example, if you're doing binary classification, you can use all the probability outputs of your individual models as inputs to a final logistic regression (or any model, really) that can combine the probability estimates.

One very important point is to make sure that the output of your models are out-of-sample predictions. This means that the predicted value for any row in your data-frame should NOT depend on the actual value for that row.

16. Given that you have wifi data in your office, how would you determine which rooms and areas are underutilized and over-utilized?

22. You have 100 mathletes and 100 math problems. Each mathlete gets to choose 10 problems to solve. Given data on who got what problem correct, how would you rank the problems in terms of difficulty?
One way you could do this is by storing a "skill level" for each user and a "difficulty level" for each problem.  We assume that the probability that a user solves a problem only depends on the skill of the user and the difficulty of the problem.*  Then we maximize the likelihood of the data to find the hidden skill and difficulty levels.
The Rasch model for dichotomous data takes the form:
{\displaystyle \Pr\{X_{ni}=1\}={\frac {\exp({\beta_{n}}-{\delta_{i}})}{1+\exp({\beta_{n}}-{\delta_{i}})}},}
where  is the ability of person  and  is the difficulty of item}.
23. You have 5000 people that rank 10 sushis in terms of saltiness. How would you aggregate this data to estimate the true saltiness rank in each sushi?
Some people would take the mean rank of each sushi.  If I wanted something simple, I would use the median, since ranks are (strictly speaking) ordinal and not interval, so adding them is a bit risque (but people do it all the time and you probably won't be far wrong).
24. Given data on congressional bills and which congressional representatives co-sponsored the bills, how would you determine which other representatives are most similar to yours in voting behavior? How would you evaluate who is the most liberal? Most republican? Most bipartisan?

Q1: What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?
Answer: Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm you’re using. This can lead to the model underfitting your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy and for you to generalize your knowledge from the training set to the test set.

Variance is error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm you’re using. This leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in your training data, which can lead your model to overfit the data. You’ll be carrying too much noise from your training data for your model to be very useful for your test data.

The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, the variance and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. Essentially, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose bias but gain some variance — in order to get the optimally reduced amount of error, you’ll have to tradeoff bias and variance. You don’t want either high bias or high variance in your model.

More reading: Bias-Variance Tradeoff (Wikipedia)

Q2: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?
Answer: Supervised learning requires training labeled data. For example, in order to do classification (a supervised learning task), you’ll need to first label the data you’ll use to train the model to classify data into your labeled groups. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, does not require labeling data explicitly.

More reading: Classic examples of supervised vs. unsupervised learning (Springboard)

Q3: How is KNN different from k-means clustering?
Answer: K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.

The critical difference here is that KNN needs labeled points and is thus supervised learning, while k-means doesn’t—and is thus unsupervised learning.

Q4: Explain how a ROC curve works.
Answer: The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. It’s often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity of the model (true positives) vs the fall-out or the probability it will trigger a false alarm (false positives).

More reading: Receiver operating characteristic (Wikipedia)

Q5: Define precision and recall.
Answer: Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there are throughout the data. Precision is also known as the positive predictive value, and it is a measure of the amount of accurate positives your model claims compared to the number of positives it actually claims. It can be easier to think of recall and precision in the context of a case where you’ve predicted that there were 10 apples and 5 oranges in a case of 10 apples. You’d have perfect recall (there are actually 10 apples, and you predicted there would be 10) but 66.7% precision because out of the 15 events you predicted, only 10 (the apples) are correct.

More reading: Precision and recall (Wikipedia)

Q6: What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context?
Answer: Bayes’ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge.

Mathematically, it’s expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60% chance of actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had the flu, the test will be false 50% of the time, and the overall population only has a 5% chance of having the flu. Would you actually have a 60% chance of having the flu after having a positive test?

Bayes’ Theorem says no. It says that you have a (.6 * 0.05) (True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) / (.6*0.05)(True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) + (.5*0.95) (False Positive Rate of a Population)  = 0.0594 or 5.94% chance of getting a flu.

Bayes’ Theorem is the basis behind a branch of machine learning that most notably includes the Naive Bayes classifier. That’s something important to consider when you’re faced with machine learning interview questions.

More reading: An Intuitive (and Short) Explanation of Bayes’ Theorem (BetterExplained)

Q7: Why is “Naive” Bayes naive?
Answer: Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive Bayes is considered “Naive” because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probability is calculated as the pure product of the individual probabilities of components. This implies the absolute independence of features — a condition probably never met in real life.

As a Quora commenter put it whimsically, a Naive Bayes classifier that figured out that you liked pickles and ice cream would probably naively recommend you a pickle ice cream.

Q8: Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.
Answer: L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior on the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior.

Make sure you have a choice and make sure you can explain different algorithms so simply and effectively that a five-year-old could grasp the basics!

Q10: What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?
Answer: Don’t think that this is a trick question! Many machine learning interview questions will be an attempt to lob basic questions at you just to make sure you’re on top of your game and you’ve prepared all of your bases.

Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened when it hasn’t, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is happening when in fact something is.

A clever way to think about this is to think of Type I error as telling a man he is pregnant, while Type II error means you tell a pregnant woman she isn’t carrying a baby.

Q11: What’s a Fourier transform?
Answer: A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic functions into a superposition of symmetric functions. Or as this more intuitive tutorial puts it, given a smoothie, it’s how we find the recipe. The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes, and phases to match any time signal. A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domain—it’s a very common way to extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sensor data.

Q13: What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?
Answer: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data. In that sense, deep learning represents an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets.

Q14: What’s the difference between a generative and discriminative model?
Answer: A generative model will learn categories of data while a discriminative model will simply learn the distinction between different categories of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform generative models on classification tasks.

Q15: What cross-validation technique would you use on a time series dataset?
Answer: Instead of using standard k-folds cross-validation, you have to pay attention to the fact that a time series is not randomly distributed data—it is inherently ordered by chronological order. If a pattern emerges in later time periods, for example, your model may still pick up on it even if that effect doesn’t hold in earlier years!

You’ll want to do something like forward chaining where you’ll be able to model on past data then look at forward-facing data.

Fold 1 : training [1], test [2]
Fold 2 : training [1 2], test [3]
Fold 3 : training [1 2 3], test [4]
Fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4], test [5]
Fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6]

Q16: How is a decision tree pruned?
Answer: Pruning is what happens in decision trees when branches that have weak predictive power are removed in order to reduce the complexity of the model and increase the predictive accuracy of a decision tree model. Pruning can happen bottom-up and top-down, with approaches such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity pruning.

Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each node. If it doesn’t decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned. While simple, this heuristic actually comes pretty close to an approach that would optimize for maximum accuracy.

Q17: Which is more important to you: model accuracy or model performance?
Answer: This question tests your grasp of the nuances of machine learning model performance! Machine learning interview questions often look towards the details. There are models with higher accuracy that can perform worse in predictive power—how does that make sense?

Well, it has everything to do with how model accuracy is only a subset of model performance, and at that, a sometimes misleading one. For example, if you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud. However, this would be useless for a predictive model—a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy isn’t the be-all and end-all of model performance.

Q18: What’s the F1 score? How would you use it?
Answer: The F1 score is a measure of a model’s performance. It is a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would use it in classification tests where true negatives don’t matter much.

More reading: F1 score (Wikipedia)

Q19: How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?
Answer: An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the hump:

Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset.
Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances.
Try a different algorithm altogether on your dataset.
What’s important here is that you have a keen sense for what damage an unbalanced dataset can cause, and how to balance that.

Q20: When should you use classification over regression?
Answer: Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict categories, while regression gives you continuous results that allow you to better distinguish differences between individual points. You would use classification over regression if you wanted your results to reflect the belongingness of data points in your dataset to certain explicit categories (ex: If you wanted to know whether a name was male or female rather than just how correlated they were with male and female names.)

More reading: Regression vs Classification (Math StackExchange)

Q21: Name an example where ensemble techniques might be useful.
Answer: Ensemble techniques use a combination of learning algorithms to optimize better predictive performance. They typically reduce overfitting in models and make the model more robust (unlikely to be influenced by small changes in the training data). 

You could list some examples of ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, the “bucket of models” method) and demonstrate how they could increase predictive power.

More reading: Ensemble learning (Wikipedia)

Q22: How do you ensure you’re not overfitting with a model?
Answer: This is a simple restatement of a fundamental problem in machine learning: the possibility of overfitting training data and carrying the noise of that data through to the test set, thereby providing inaccurate generalizations.

There are three main methods to avoid overfitting:

Keep the model simpler: reduce variance by taking into account fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data.
Use cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.
Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain model parameters if they’re likely to cause overfitting.
More reading: How can I avoid overfitting? (Quora)

Q23: What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?
Answer: You would first split the dataset into training and test sets, or perhaps use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data. You should then implement a choice selection of performance metrics: here is a fairly comprehensive list. You could use measures such as the F1 score, the accuracy, and the confusion matrix. What’s important here is to demonstrate that you understand the nuances of how a model is measured and how to choose the right performance measures for the right situations.

Q25: What’s the “kernel trick” and how is it useful?
Answer: The Kernel trick involves kernel functions that can enable in higher-dimension spaces without explicitly calculating the coordinates of points within that dimension: instead, kernel functions compute the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in a feature space. This allows them the very useful attribute of calculating the coordinates of higher dimensions while being computationally cheaper than the explicit calculation of said coordinates. Many algorithms can be expressed in terms of inner products. Using the kernel trick enables us effectively run algorithms in a high-dimensional space with lower-dimensional data.

Q26: How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset?
Answer: You could find missing/corrupted data in a dataset and either drop those rows or columns, or decide to replace them with another value.

In Pandas, there are two very useful methods: isnull() and dropna() that will help you find columns of data with missing or corrupted data and drop those values. If you want to fill the invalid values with a placeholder value (for example, 0), you could use the fillna() method.

Q29: What are some differences between a linked list and an array?
Answer: An array is an ordered collection of objects. A linked list is a series of objects with pointers that direct how to process them sequentially. An array assumes that every element has the same size, unlike the linked list. A linked list can more easily grow organically: an array has to be pre-defined or re-defined for organic growth. Shuffling a linked list involves changing which points direct where—meanwhile, shuffling an array is more complex and takes more memory.

Q32: Given two strings, A and B, of the same length n, find whether it is possible to cut both strings at a common point such that the first part of A and the second part of B form a palindrome.
Answer: You’ll often get standard algorithms and data structures questions as part of your interview process as a machine learning engineer that might feel akin to a software engineering interview. In this case, this comes from Google’s interview process. There are multiple ways to check for palindromes—one way of doing so if you’re using a programming language such as Python is to reverse the string and check to see if it still equals the original string, for example. The thing to look out for here is the category of questions you can expect, which will be akin to software engineering questions that drill down to your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Make sure that you’re totally comfortable with the language of your choice to express that logic.

More reading: What is the difference between a primary and foreign key in SQL?

Q34: How does XML and CSVs compare in terms of size?
Answer: In practice, XML is much more verbose than CSVs are and takes up a lot more space. CSVs use some separators to categorize and organize data into neat columns. XML uses tags to delineate a tree-like structure for key-value pairs. You’ll often get XML back as a way to semi-structure data from APIs or HTTP responses. In practice, you’ll want to ingest XML data and try to process it into a usable CSV. This sort of question tests your familiarity with data wrangling sometimes messy data formats.
