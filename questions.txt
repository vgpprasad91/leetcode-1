1. In an A/B test, how can you check if assignment to the various buckets was truly random?
Plot the distributions of multiple features for both A and B and make sure that they have the same shape. More rigorously, we can conduct a permutation test to see if the distributions are the same.
MANOVA to compare different means
---------------------
2. What might be the benefits of running an A/A test, where you have two buckets who are exposed to the exact same product?
Verify the sampling algorithm is random.
3. What would be the hazards of letting users sneak a peek at the other bucket in an A/B test?
The user might not act the same suppose had they not seen the other bucket. You are essentially adding additional variables of whether the user peeked the other bucket, which are not random across groups.
4. What would be some issues if blogs decide to cover one of your experimental groups?
Same as the previous question. The above problem can happen in larger scale.
5. How would you conduct an A/B test on an opt-in feature? 
Ask someone for more details.
6. How would you run an A/B test for many variants, say 20 or more?
one control, 20 treatment, if the sample size for each group is big enough.
Ways to attempt to correct for this include changing your confidence level (e.g. Bonferroni Correction) or doing family-wide tests before you dive in to the individual metrics (e.g. Fisher's Protected LSD).
7. How would you run an A/B test if the observations are extremely right-skewed?
lower the variability by modifying the KPI
cap values
percentile metrics
log transform

9. What is a p-value? What is the difference between type-1 and type-2 error?
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value
type-1 error: rejecting Ho when Ho is true

10. You are AirBnB and you want to test the hypothesis that a greater number of photographs increases the chances that a buyer selects the listing. How would you test this hypothesis?
For randomly selected listings with more than 1 pictures, hide 1 random picture for group A, and show all for group B. Compare the booking rate for the two groups.
Ask someone for more details.
11. How would you design an experiment to determine the impact of latency on user engagement?
The best way I know to quantify the impact of performance is to isolate just that factor using a slowdown experiment, i.e., add a delay in an A/B test.
12. What is maximum likelihood estimation? Could there be any case where it doesn’t exist?
A method for parameter optimization (fitting a model). We choose parameters so as to maximize the likelihood function (how likely the outcome would happen given the current data and our model).
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations, by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters. MLE can be seen as a special case of the maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters, or as a variant of the MAP that ignores the prior and which therefore is unregularized.
for gaussian mixtures, non parametric models, it doesn’t exist
13. What’s the difference between a MAP, MOM, MLE estimator? In which cases would you want to use each?
MAP estimates the posterior distribution given the prior distribution and data which maximizes the likelihood function. MLE is a special case of MAP where the prior is uninformative uniform distribution.
MOM sets moment values and solves for the parameters. MOM is not used much anymore because maximum likelihood estimators have higher probability of being close to the quantities to be estimated and are more often unbiased.
14. What is a confidence interval and how do you interpret it?
For example, 95% confidence interval is an interval that when constructed for a set of samples each sampled in the same way, the constructed intervals include the true mean 95% of the time.
if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level in an infinite number of independent experiments, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level.
15. What is unbiasedness as a property of an estimator? Is this always a desirable property when performing inference? What about in data analysis or predictive modeling?
Unbiasedness means that the expectation of the estimator is equal to the population value we are estimating. This is desirable in inference because the goal is to explain the dataset as accurately as possible. However, this is not always desirable for data analysis or predictive modeling as there is the bias variance tradeoff. We sometimes want to prioritize the generalizability and avoid overfitting by reducing variance and thus increasing bias.

Average Revenue Per Paid User
Average Revenue Per User
6. A certain metric is violating your expectations by going down or up more than you expect. How would you try to identify the cause of the change?
breakdown the KPI’s into what consists them and find where the change is
then further breakdown that basic KPI by channel, user cluster, etc. and relate them with any campaigns, changes in user behaviors in that segment
7. Growth for total number of tweets sent has been slow this month. What data would you look at to determine the cause of the problem?
Historical data, especially historical data at the same month
Outer data, such as economic data, political data, data about competitors
8. You’re a restaurant and are approached by Groupon to run a deal. What data would you ask from them in order to determine whether or not to do the deal?

Time decay: the older the less important
11. How would you measure the impact that sponsored stories on Facebook News Feed have on user engagement? How would you determine the optimum balance between sponsored stories and organic content on a user’s News Feed?
AB test on different balance ratio and see 
12. You are on the data science team at Uber and you are asked to start thinking about surge pricing. What would be the objectives of such a product and how would you start looking into this?
 there is a gradual step-function type scaling mechanism until that imbalance of requests-to-drivers is alleviated and then vice versa as too many drivers come online enticed by the surge pricing structure. 
I would bet the algorithm is custom tailored and calibrated to each location as price elasticities almost certainly vary across different cities depending on a huge multitude of variables: income, distance/sprawl, traffic patterns, car ownership, etc. With the massive troves of user data that Uber probably has collected, they most likely have tweaked the algorithms for each city to adjust for these varying sensitivities to surge pricing. Throw in some machine learning and incredibly rich data and you've got yourself an incredible, constantly-evolving algorithm.
13. Say that you are Netflix. How would you determine what original series you should invest in and create?

1. (Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and tell me what you can learn from it.
Typical data cleaning and visualization
2. What is R2? What are some other metrics that could be better than R2 and why?
goodness of fit measure. variance explained by the regression / total variance
the more predictors you add, the higher R^2 becomes.
hence use adjusted R^2 which adjusts for the degrees of freedom 
or train error metrics
3. What is the curse of dimensionality?
High dimensionality makes clustering hard, because having lots of dimensions means that everything is "far away" from each other.
For example, to cover a fraction of the volume of the data we need to capture a very wide range for each variable as the number of variables increases
All samples are close to the edge of the sample. And this is a bad news because prediction is much more difficult near the edges of the training sample.
The sampling density decreases exponentially as p increases and hence the data becomes much more sparse without significantly more data. 
We should conduct PCA to reduce dimensionality
4. Is more data always better?
Statistically
It depends on the quality of your data, for example, if your data is biased, just getting more data won’t help.
It depends on your model. If your model suffers from high bias, getting more data won’t improve your test results beyond a point. You’d need to add more features, etc.
Practically
More data usually benefit the models
Also there’s a tradeoff between having more data and the additional storage, computational power, memory it requires. Hence, always think about the cost of having more data.
5. What are advantages of plotting your data before performing analysis?
Data sets have errors. You won't find them all but you might find some. That 212 year old man. That 9 foot tall woman.
Variables can have skewness, outliers, etc. Then the arithmetic mean might not be useful, which means the standard deviation isn't useful.
Variables can be multimodal! If a variable is multimodal then anything based on its mean or median is going to be suspect. 
6. How can you make sure that you don’t analyze something that ends up meaningless?
Proper exploratory data analysis.
In every data analysis task, there's the exploratory phase where you're just graphing things, testing things on small sets of the data, summarizing simple statistics, and getting rough ideas of what hypotheses you might want to pursue further.
Then there's the exploratory phase, where you look deeply into a set of hypotheses. 
The exploratory phase will generate lots of possible hypotheses, and the exploratory phase will let you really understand a few of them. Balance the two and you'll prevent yourself from wasting time on many things that end up meaningless, although not all.
7. What is the role of trial and error in data analysis? What is the the role of making a hypothesis before diving in?
data analysis is a repetition of setting up a new hypothesis and trying to refute the null hypothesis.
The scientific method is eminently inductive: we elaborate a hypothesis, test it and refute it or not. As a result, we come up with new hypotheses which are in turn tested and so on. This is an iterative process, as science always is.
8. How can you determine which features are the most important in your model?
Linear regression can use p-value
run the features though a Gradient Boosting Machine or Random Forest to generate plots of relative importance and information gain for each feature in the ensembles.
Look at the variables added in forward variable selection 
9. How do you deal with some of your predictors being missing?
Remove rows with missing values - This works well if
the values are missing randomly (see Vinay Prabhu's answer for more details on this)
if you don't lose too much of the dataset after doing so.
Build another predictive model to predict the missing values
This could be a whole project in itself, so simple techniques are usually used here.
Use a model that can incorporate missing data 
Like a random forest, or any tree-based method.
10. You have several variables that are positively correlated with your response, and you think combining all of the variables could give you a good prediction of your response. However, you see that in the multiple linear regression, one of the weights on the predictors is negative. What could be the issue?
Multicollinearity refers to a situation in which two or more explanatory variables in a multiple regression model are highly linearly related. 
Leave the model as is, despite multicollinearity. The presence of multicollinearity doesn't affect the efficiency of extrapolating the fitted model to new data provided that the predictor variables follow the same pattern of multicollinearity in the new data as in the data on which the regression model is based.
principal component regression
11. Let’s say you’re given an unfeasible amount of predictors in a predictive modeling task. What are some ways to make the prediction more feasible?
PCA
12. Now you have a feasible amount of predictors, but you’re fairly sure that you don’t need all of them. How would you perform feature selection on the dataset?
ridge / lasso / elastic net regression
Univariate Feature Selection where a statistical test is applied to each feature individually. You retain only the best features according to the test outcome scores
Recursive Feature Elimination:
First, train a model with all the feature and evaluate its performance on held out data.
Then drop let say the 10% weakest features (e.g. the feature with least absolute coefficients in a linear model) and retrain on the remaining features.
Iterate until you observe a sharp drop in the predictive accuracy of the model.
13. Your linear regression didn’t run and communicates that there are an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients. What could be wrong?
p > n.
If some of the explanatory variables are perfectly correlated (positively or negatively) then the coefficients would not be unique. 
14. You run your regression on different subsets of your data, and find that in each subset, the beta value for a certain variable varies wildly. What could be the issue here?
The dataset might be heterogeneous. In which case, it is recommended to cluster datasets into different subsets wisely, and then draw different models for different subsets. Or, use models like non parametric models (trees) which can deal with heterogeneity quite nicely.
15. What is the main idea behind ensemble learning? If I had many different models that predicted the same response variable, what might I want to do to incorporate all of the models? Would you expect this to perform better than an individual model or worse?
The assumption is that a group of weak learners can be combined to form a strong learner.
Hence the combined model is expected to perform better than an individual model.
Assumptions:
average out biases
reduce variance
Bagging works because some underlying learning algorithms are unstable: slightly different inputs leads to very different outputs. If you can take advantage of this instability by running multiple instances, it can be shown that the reduced instability leads to lower error. If you want to understand why, the original bagging paper( http://www.springerlink.com/) has a section called "why bagging works"
Boosting works because of the focus on better defining the "decision edge". By re-weighting examples near the margin (the positive and negative examples) you get a reduced error (see http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie...)
Use the outputs of your models as inputs to a meta-model. 
For example, if you're doing binary classification, you can use all the probability outputs of your individual models as inputs to a final logistic regression (or any model, really) that can combine the probability estimates.

One very important point is to make sure that the output of your models are out-of-sample predictions. This means that the predicted value for any row in your data-frame should NOT depend on the actual value for that row.

22. You have 100 mathletes and 100 math problems. Each mathlete gets to choose 10 problems to solve. Given data on who got what problem correct, how would you rank the problems in terms of difficulty?
One way you could do this is by storing a "skill level" for each user and a "difficulty level" for each problem.  We assume that the probability that a user solves a problem only depends on the skill of the user and the difficulty of the problem.*  Then we maximize the likelihood of the data to find the hidden skill and difficulty levels.
The Rasch model for dichotomous data takes the form:
{\displaystyle \Pr\{X_{ni}=1\}={\frac {\exp({\beta_{n}}-{\delta_{i}})}{1+\exp({\beta_{n}}-{\delta_{i}})}},}
where  is the ability of person  and  is the difficulty of item}.
23. You have 5000 people that rank 10 sushis in terms of saltiness. How would you aggregate this data to estimate the true saltiness rank in each sushi?
Some people would take the mean rank of each sushi.  If I wanted something simple, I would use the median, since ranks are (strictly speaking) ordinal and not interval, so adding them is a bit risque (but people do it all the time and you probably won't be far wrong).
24. Given data on congressional bills and which congressional representatives co-sponsored the bills, how would you determine which other representatives are most similar to yours in voting behavior? How would you evaluate who is the most liberal? Most republican? Most bipartisan?
